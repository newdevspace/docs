## Manifesto

### Principle 1. General Disposition
    
#### Use a methodical approach: 
1. **organize** your **knowledge** (e.g. using Trello, Evernote, etc.)
2. **organize** your **schedule** wisely with the rotation of work and leisure
3. try to **not repeat** your **errors**, learn on them, note them
4. **surround** yourself **with** all the **data**, relevant to the current *problem*
5. use ***differential search*** when you feel troubles or tired
6. always **improve yourself**, use gained knowledge in different life arias

#### Appreciate your time:
1. **limit** *problems* search (e.g. 1.5h)
2. **note** the hardest *problems* to discuss with the *mentor* later on WORK meeting
3. **automate** your environments, find patterns in your work, try to not repeat the same actions

#### Be a smart warrior (metaphoric part):
1. **never give up**, everything will be resolved you just did not find the answer yet
2. **challenge yourself** with the *problems* as you dealing with the virtual enemies
3. **win** battles **one by one**, enjoy your successes and get used to this feeling
4. **make a feast** for yourself after defeating the enemy

### Principle 2. Process Handling
1. the ***process* is volatile**, change it, update it, improve it using new knowledge
2. the ***process*** is the law, stick to the rules you made
3. **document** *process*, **know the docs**, use them as a judge and a counselor
4. break the process into three *sub-processes*: theory, practice, interview preparation
5. apply your subjective **intense** and **time limits** to the *sub-processes* (e.g. in percent to the whole process)
6. **break** the *sub-process* into *issues*
7. **trek** *issues* in the state (using Kanban board) and time (using time tracker)
8. **concentrate efforts**, other board states than 'ToDo', 'Done' and 'Closed', must contain no more than 2 issues for each *sub-process*

### Principle 3. Use Logic
1. **simplify** each *problem/issue* in data amount and/or implementation
2. **divide** each *problem/issue* into smaller ones if it still seems complicated

### Principle 4. Final
1. **reread** above if you came here and have no answer
2. **improve** the MANIFESTO if there still no answer

### Glossary:

*Problem* – data without clear understanding, questionable information.

*Differential search* – nominal term, here indicates the method of using different ways of learning (e.g. visual, interactive, printed, etc.) and different data sources.

*Mentor* – the sphere professional, who could be a judge for student knowledge.

*WORK meeting* – see “Meetings” doc.

*Process* – educational process all participants involved to.

*Sub-process* – sections of the process broken-down into issues, described and tracked on the Kanban board.

*Issue* – logically finite participle of knowledge related to one of the three sub-processes, specified on the Kanban board taken through the process.
