#### Principle 1. General Disposition
    
##### Use a methodical approach: 
1. organize your knowledge (e.g. using Trello, Evernote, etc.)

2. organize your schedule wisely with the rotation of work and leisure
3. try to not repeat your errors, learn on them, note them
4. surround yourself with all the data, relevant to the current problem
5. use differential search when you feel troubles or tired
6. always improve yourself, use gained knowledge in different life arias

##### Appreciate your time:
limit problems search (e.g. 1.5h)
note the hardest problems to discuss with the mentor later on WORK meeting
automate your environments, find patterns in your work, try to not repeat the same actions

##### Be a smart warrior (metaphoric part):
never give up, everything will be resolved you just did not find the answer yet
challenge yourself with the problems as you dealing with the virtual enemies
win battles one by one, enjoy your successes and get used to this feeling
make a feast for yourself after defeating the enemy

#### Principle 2. Process Handling
the process is volatile, change it, update it, improve it using new knowledge
the process is the law, stick to the rules you made
document process, know the docs, use them as a judge and a counselor
break the process into three sub-processes: theory, practice, interview preparation
apply your subjective intense and time limits to the sub-processes (e.g. in percent to the whole process)
break the sub-process into issues
trek issues in the state (using Kanban board) and time (using time tracker)
concentrate efforts, other board states than 'ToDo', 'Done' and 'Closed', must contain no more than 2 issues for each sub-process
#### Principle 3. Use Logic
simplify each problem/issue in data amount and/or implementation
divide each problem/issue into smaller ones if it still seems complicated
#### Principle 4. Final
reread above if you came here and have no answer
improve the MANIFESTO if there still no answer
